# SequenceScript
SequenceScript is a scripting language designed to script, you guessed it,
sequences. It is based on the ATLUS modding docs found at [shrinefox](https://docs.shrinefox.com/flowscript/intro-to-scripting), and
aims to provide similar functionality(maybe with more tasteful syntax and whatnot).
