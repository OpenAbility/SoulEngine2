# The runtime binaries folder
In here we stick all the binaries for libraries, e.g FFMpeg etc

I use .so but it might be .dll or something like that if you're a windows person.

## Required Libraries/Folders
ImGui binaries:
- imgui.so/imgui.dll
- 
Just ask jimmy for how to build them. It's not pretty.
